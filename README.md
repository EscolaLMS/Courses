## Model relation

The model user must be extended with the class HasCourses :
```
class User extends EscolaLms\Core\Models\User
{
    use HasCourses;
```

## Database relation

There is simple relation. [see docs for diagram](doc)

1. `Course` general category of the course
2. `Lesson` grouped by Course
3. `Topic` grouped by Lesson

```
Course 1 -> n Lesson
Lesson 1 -> n Topic
Topic 1 -> 1 TopicContent
```

`TopicContent` is an abstract model, this package contains some sample implementatio eg, `RichText`, `Audio`, `Video`, `H5P` and `Image`

You create any of the Content model by post to the same Topic endponit (create and update), [see docs examples](doc)

**Note** that `/api/topics` is using `form-data` - this is due to PHP nature of posting files

List of possible `TopicContent`s is availabe in the endpoint `/api/topics/types`

## Curriculum/Sylabus/Program

App user access the course by fetching `GET /api/courses/{id}/program` endpoint. This is after user purchase or has other access to the course. this endpoints renders tree of Course, Lessons, Topic with Contents essential to render whole course.

## Adding new `TopicContent` type

In the ServiceProvider register your class like

```php
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use EscolaLms\Courses\Repositories\TopicRepository;
use CustomPackage\Models\TopicContentCustom;


class CustomServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{

    //...

    public function register()
    {
        TopicRepository::registerContentClass(TopicContentCustom::class);
    }
}
```

see [EscolaLmsCourseServiceProvider.php](src/EscolaLmsCourseServiceProvider.php) as reference as well as [Models/TopicContent](package2/src/Models/TopicContent)
